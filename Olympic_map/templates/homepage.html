        <h2 style="color:tan;">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project is, as selected by the members of the team, to determine if the variables of a country's GDP per capita, population, and number of competitors sent either individually or in aggregated has any predictive value on the total medal count that a country has in the Olympic Games. In order to do that, we have planned a series of linear regressions to test the three single variable hypotheses, namely that the three variables noted above individually have predictive value on the total medal count of a country. As we expect that those hypotheses will fail or only have week predictive value, we want to test the hypothesis that the three variables in aggregate have predictive value on the medal count using both multi-linear regression and machine learning strategies.

            <h2 style="color:tan;">Data Processing Strategy</h2>
            <p>A number of challeges presented decisions the group needed to make regarding the scope of the analysis. With regard to the two seasons of the Olympic Games, we chose to analyze both seasons separately believing that the patterns of strong countries vs. weaker countries would be significantly different to potential skew the results if they were analyzed together. Due to the limitations of the data on population and GDP, the group decided to limit the date range for the both seasons' games from 1960 to 2018, reserving the 2020 summer games in Tokyo (played in 2021) and the 2022 winter games to be used as proof of concept.
              <br>
              <br> Additionally, the group decided that in team events, only one medal will count (each individual competitor gets a medal) and only one competitor will count in the competitor count. The decision was made to only count one compeititor from each team as the dataset we used to get an athlete count for each country in each of the olympics listed each member of a team. By including each of those members, the data would have been skewed as each member would have won a medal but only one medal for a team counts in the final medal count for each olympics. The goal was to filter the dataset to only count medal opportunities. This required using Jupyter Notebook to filter the athlete dataset for each team participating in a traditional team sport (basketball, hockey, volleyball, etc...) and dropping all team members but one from each team event in the olympics. Additionally, the competitors that competed in events that are not traditional team sports also had to be filtered out. Examples of non-traditional team sports include doubles tennis, track and field relays, team rowing, etc... To filter duplicates from these events, the dataset was filtered by events that contained words such as doubles, team, two-man, etc... After the traditional team sports and non-traditional team sports were filtered, we were able to get an accurate count of medal opportunities for each country in each of the olympics in the dataset.</p>
              <br> The data collected will be organized in the following graphical DBD map (this and the text script varients can be found <a href="https://github.com/olympics2022/olympic_medal_analysis/tree/main/DataBaseMap">here</a>)

              <h2 style="color:tan;">Methodology</h2>
              <h4 style="color:tan;">Ms Excel</h4>
              <p>While some of our data was downloaded directly as CSV files, the medal count information was not in CSV format so in order to collect the that data we needed to first scrape the Wikipedia sites via MS Excel Get Data command. We also used Excel's VLOOKUP to add information, specifically NOC codes to all the tables for eventual use as foreign keys in the database, in addition to some other basic preprocessing to ensure proper formating.</p>
              <h4 style="color:tan;">PostGres / SQL</h4>
              <p>Once the Excel-processed CSV files were completed, using SQL, a database was set up within PostGres to hold all the data. Additionally, we made use of SQL to preprocess and merge all the files into the final table from which all analyses would be based from: x_medal_share.</p>
              <h4 style="color:tan;">Python</h4>
              <p> We were able to import the x_medal_share into a pandas dataframe within python. From there we separated Winter from Summer to run the the data separately in as it was determined that the dynamics would be sufficiently different to warrant treating them independent of each other. Python was used to run the linear regressions (single- variable and multi-variable) as well as the machine modelling.</p>
              <h4 style="color:tan;">Modelling</h4>
              <p>We decided to first determine if any of the three variables (GDP per capita, population, and number of competitors) individually had any correlation to number of medals won by a given country. In addition, we wanted to look at a multi-variable linear regression with those three variables in addition to the boolean variable of being the host country of the given Olympic games. Furthermore, we fed the four variables into a linear regression supervised machine learning model to see if that could produce a better fit.</p>
          <br><p>In looking at the four variables above we wanted to group the data into clusters that may show similarities other than simply the individual variables themselves so we performed a K-Means unsupervised model and subsequently took those groups and ran them through two supervised machine-learning models: Balanced Random Forest classifier and Easy Ensemble classifier models.</p>

          <h4 style="color:tan;"><b>Summary</b></h4>
        <p>In looking at the single-variable, linear regressions we can see that while all the variables tested (athlete share, population, and GDP per capita) had a significant impact on medal share for both the Winter and Summer Olympics, the range for the R^2 valuse (combining both sets) was from 2.8% - 66%. It is interesting to note that by far the most salient factor in the medal share was the number of competitors sent to the games (Summer: 66%, Winter: 55%). In addition, it's worth noting that the summer games it was population that had the next most impact on the count whereas GDP was the second most impact on the winter games. This may indicate that wealth has a greater significance for the winter games rather than the summer games. In any case, even if we take the best R^2 result of 66%, this doesn't give us enough statistical power to claim that one variable alone can predict the medal count in a given Olympic year.

          <br>It was postulated then that maybe all variables combined may have better predictive power than any one variable alone. Added to the three variables above, we added a boolean variable, whether the country was hosting that year or not, which didn't lend itself well to a single-variable, linear regression. The multiple linear regression gave us an R^2 of 66.2% for summer and an R^2 of 57.3% for winter.
          <br>
          <br>In an effort to increase the value of the predictability for our models we opted to try a machine learning module for a multiple linear regression on the four variables. When run against the 2014 Winter and 2016 Summer games, the winter averaged a difference of 1.98 medals from actual numbers and the summer averaged a difference of 2.88 medals from actual numbers. This indicates a limited use of these four variables for predictability but given this isn't a life or death situation, it could still be used to give a general idea of what to expect. I just wouldn't bet your savings on it without a generous over/under.
          <br>
          <br>Our approach however does open up some potential inadequacies. Particularly glaring is that this approach does not take into account the athletes and their relative skill. The models accuracy definitely has room for improvement and that would definitely be and source for new data. In addition our choices in limiting counts to potential medals won and therefore removing all team members but one from all team sports could have created artifacts that would challenge the results.</p>
